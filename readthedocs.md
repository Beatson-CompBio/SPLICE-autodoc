After creating a new repository to be documented, go to your ReadTheDocs dashboard. Click the Add Project button and locate the repository you want to document. You can change the name and/or default branch for the project if needed.

Back in your repository, ensure that there is:

- a .readthedocs.yaml file
- a pyproject.toml and/or requirements.txt file
- the required files for Sphinx: make.bat, Makefile, conf.py and index.rst

## File Descriptions

### <u> .readthedocs.yaml </u>

This is the main configuration file for RTD. It defines:

- OS and tools: e.g. Ubuntu, Python 3.12
- Dependency installation: e.g. using uv
- Sphinx configuration:
  - Path to conf.py
  - "fail_on_warning": true (stops the pages from building even if the error would not normally crash Sphinx, recommended for debugging)
- Output formats: In addition to HTML, can build PDF and EPUB

RTD uses this file to configure the environment and build process when generating the documentation.

### pyproject.toml/requirements.txt

These files specify your projectâ€™s dependencies  
In the example repo, both are included, but for simplicity, you can use only pyproject.toml.

RTD uses these to install any packages needed for documentation generation (e.g., Sphinx, extensions, imports for your Python files).

### Sphinx files

The files in the first bullet point are automatically made if you use sphinx-quickstart.

- Makefile/make.bat: Only necessary if you want to manually build the documentation pages as RTD directly runs sphinx-build
- conf.py: Main configuration for Sphinx
- index.rst: Homepage

### conf.py

Configuration options for sphinx, includes:

- Project metadata
- Extensions for Sphinx (like autodoc and autosummary)
- Path configurations for finding the directories that your Python files are in (uses sys and os modules)

The most important file for controlling how your documentation is formatted and controlled during generation

### index.rst

This is the homepage of your documentation.

It is good practise to include a complete toctree here, as any .rst files that are not mentioned in a toctree will not be built and will give off a warning that, if configured, could cause a build failure.

Once these are in place, you can choose whether you want to manually write up your .rst files or create a python script like the example to generate pages from specific directories. Any python scripts that need to be run must be put in the .readthedocs.yaml file to be run by RTD when it builds the pages.

Extra info

RTD runs the code in .readthedocs.yaml and then uses a set of python commands to create the web pages from the sphinx .rst files, and then runs the commands needed to create the .pdf and .epub forms of the page. In theory, could be manually done if you go through each step in the command prompt but the virtual environment refuses to install the sphinx-build function necessary to construct the .html files from the .rst files. May be a problem with the install method (using uv) but I can look further into it if necessary.
